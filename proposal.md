# rename-and-refile
Take files from any software on the PC and ensure proper naming convention that can be set, then place it in the proper folder. This will help streamline file organization and project updates so that files don't fall through the cracks due to improper management and naming

### features
 1. Read the file name and type
 2. Ask what folder it needs to be sorted into
 3. Read the names of other files within that folder, and match the naming convention numerically
 4. Update file placement when the name of a file is updated

### challenges
 1. matching names between files and folders

### ideal outcome
 ideally, this project will be able to interface with OBS, Obsidian, browser  Downloads, Maya, Adobe, and Clip Studio Paint

### minimal outcome
 minimally, this project will be able to work with OBS, browser downloads, and Clip Studio Paint

### milestones
 Since I started late, by the end of this week, I will have the reading for the file names up. By the end of next week, I'll have identification and sorting for file types complete. For the last week, I'll complete the function that sorts files according to their renaming.
